# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for everything but vim,
to manage this I use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm), that you can install by typing

```
brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
brew install rcm
```

And then cloning the repo into `~/Dotfiles`, then

```
ln -s ~/Dotfiles/rcrc ~/.rcrc
lsrc
```
